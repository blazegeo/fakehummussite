   <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1> 

    <p>This recipe makes <em>quick, tasty hummus, with no messing</em>. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
   <li>A dash of olive oil</li> 
   </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
   <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li> 
     <ul>
      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
     </ul>
    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
   </ol>
    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. <strong>If it starts to become <em>fizzy</em>, you should definitely discard it</strong>.</p>

    <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
